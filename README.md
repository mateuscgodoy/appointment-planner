# Appointments Planner by Codecademy

## Goal

Build a Single Page Application capable of registring contacts and appointments.

## Description

This project is an exercise from Codecademy. The objective is to practice structural knowledge related with React Framework, including, but not only:

- JSX;
- React Components;
- Components Interacting;
- Hooks;
- React Programming Patterns;
- _etc_;

On top of that, in the future, I would like to expand the concepts from this exercise adding two new Libraries:

1. React Router DOM;
2. Material UI;
